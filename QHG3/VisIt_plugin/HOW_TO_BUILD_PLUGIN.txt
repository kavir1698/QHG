Just run the script 

./BUILD_PLUGIN.sh

and it should work. 

More in detail:

If your visit install directory (the one where you have the "visit"
executable. e.g. /usr/local/visit/bin) is VISIT_DIR, then these are
the steps to build the QDF plugin:

1) cd QHGsources

2) make

3) cd ..

4) ${VISIT_DIR}/xml2cmake qdf.xml

5) cmake .

6) make

All shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well.
