File growth_term.py (folder python_script_growth_term) performs simulations based on the growth term only. For a fixed b0, (d0=0), fixed ratio = theta/b0 , and fixed K several repetitions of the simulations are performed. The output, i.e., mean numbers of individuals, is written in a text file. It is possible to perform the simulation using an array of b0 values, or/and an array of ratio, or/and an array of K values. growth_term.py was used to produced simulation results presented in Figure 4.
